Generation of diagrams and flowcharts from text in a similar manner as markdown. Ever wanted to simplify documentation and avoid heavy tools like Visio when explaining your code? This is why mermaid was born, a simple markdown-like script language for generating charts from text via javascript. **Mermaid was nominated and won the JS Open Source Awards (2019) in the category "The most exciting use of technology".**
