[C3.js - D3-based reusable chart library](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/){:target="_blank"}
[<img src="images/c3_thumbnail.png?raw=true"/>](https://c3js.org/){:target="_blank"}
C3 makes it easy to generate D3-based charts by wrapping the code required to construct the entire chart. The library provides a variety of chart types as well as APIs and callbacks to access the state of the chart and update it even after it is rendered. C3 enables deeper integration of charts into your application.<br>

[mermaid - Generation of diagrams and flowcharts from text using a markdown-like syntax](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/){:target="_blank"}
[<img src="images/mermaid_thumbnail.png?raw=true"/>](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/){:target="_blank"}
Ever wanted to simplify documentation and avoid heavy tools like Visio when explaining your code? This is why mermaid was born, a simple markdown-like script language for generating charts from text via javascript. **Mermaid was nominated and won the JS Open Source Awards (2019) in the category "The most exciting use of technology".**<br>
