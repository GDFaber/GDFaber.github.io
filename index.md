[mermaid - Generation of diagrams and flowcharts from markdown-like text](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/){:target="_blank"}
<img src="images/mermaid_thumbnail.png?raw=true"/>
Ever wanted to simplify documentation and avoid heavy tools like Visio when explaining your code? This is why mermaid was born, a simple markdown-like script language for generating charts from text via javascript. **Mermaid was nominated and won the JS Open Source Awards (2019) in the category "The most exciting use of technology".**<br>

I am glad to be a team member and a part of this beautiful project since January 2020.<br>
